<h1> Model Description ðŸ§ </h1>
This project features a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify Pepper Bell leaf images into two distinct categories:

Healthy â€” Leaves with no visible signs of disease or damage.

Defective â€” Leaves showing symptoms of disease, pest damage, or other abnormalities.

The CNN is built using TensorFlow/Keras and is designed to detect and distinguish subtle visual patterns such as color, texture, and shape differences between healthy and defective leaves.
